They\\'re about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible. That\\'s what makes them SCARY.<br /><br />- White people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.<br /><br />- If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, \\\\\"What was that?\\\\\" or, \\\\\"Where are we?\\\\\"<br /><br />- Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.<br /><br />- A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from \\\\\"student film\\\\\" to \\\\\"major studio release\\\\\". Try it!<br /><br />- Just because you can name-drop all three \\\\\"Living Dead\\\\\" movies, that does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson.<br /><br />I\\'ve seen worse movies, but only because I\\'ve seen \\\\\"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.\\\\\"\"'"

    "\n",
    "> In practice, the Bag-of-words model is mainly used as a tool of feature generation. After transforming the text into a \"bag of words\", we can calculate various measures to characterize the text. The most common type of characteristics, or features calculated from the Bag-of-words model is term frequency, namely, the number of times a term appears in the text. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the sample review '9170_1' we were examining above we notice that the word 'bad' appears twice, and the words 'worse' and 'awful' appear once.  It is highly likely that other reviews with a negative rating will also contain these words along with others such as 'hate', 'waste', etc.  In these cases the BOW decide that these reviews are similar and place them in the same 'bag' as review '9170_1' (i.e. a negative review classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia article provides another example:\n",
    ">In Bayesian spam filtering, an e-mail message is modeled as an unordered collection of words selected from one of two probability distributions: one representing spam and one representing legitimate e-mail (\"ham\"). Imagine that there are two literal bags full of words. One bag is filled with words found in spam messages, and the other bag is filled with words found in legitimate e-mail. While any given word is likely to be found somewhere in both bags, the \"spam\" bag will contain spam-related words such as \"stock\", \"Viagra\", and \"buy\" much more frequently, while the \"ham\" bag will contain more words related to the user's friends or workplace.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To classify an e-mail message, the Bayesian spam filter assumes that the message is a pile of words that has been poured out randomly from one of the two bags, and uses Bayesian probability to determine which bag it is more likely to be.\n",
