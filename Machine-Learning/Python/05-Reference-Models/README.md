# Summary

A set of reference models (mostly in TensorFlow), that saves me a lot of time having to look these things up...  ;)

* [Base neural network](./DNN-TensorFlow-Base.ipynb) - A very basic 2 layer neural network [TensorFlow] 

* [Training deeper neural networks](./DNN-TensorFlow-Training.ipynb) - Implementations for training deeper neural networks [TensorFlow]
  - Vanishing/Exploding Gradients
  - Non-saturating Activation Functions
  - Transfer Learning
  - Optimizers
  - Regularization
  
* [TensorBoard](./DNN-TensorBoard.ipynb) - Implementing TensorBoard to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow models
