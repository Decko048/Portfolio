# Communication and Writing Samples

## Overview
The following folder contains a number of writing examples illustrating clear, effective communication and writing.  The samples include:

1. Hotfix workflow
2. Release management development
3. Business writing 
4. Issue/root cause analysis

## Hotfix Workflow

Provides a diagram I created to guide the engineering department through the successful implementation and deployment of hotfixes.  The diagram was accompanied by a complete write-up detailing each step in the flow.  This process was successfully adopted by the department and was utilized on a regular basis to mitigate high priority, production affecting issues.

## Release Management

* [3.2-ReleaseManagement-HowToCreateaReleaseCandidate.pdf](https://github.com/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/master/Communication-and-Writing-Samples/3.2-ReleaseManagement-HowToCreateaReleaseCandidate.pdf)
* [3.3-ReleaseManagement-GettingStoriesfromDevelopmenttoQC.pdf](https://github.com/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/master/Communication-and-Writing-Samples/3.3-ReleaseManagement-GettingStoriesfromDevelopmenttoQC.pdf)

These next communication samples provide a timeline of my work in developing a release process for the department.  Not only was I successful in this en devour, but I was ultimately promoted to release manager and oversaw the entire process.

The first two items, 3.1. and 3.2, show my working inside the existing process, documenting them, and coaching other team members in their correct usage.  This was important, because 1) I was new to the department, and 2) I needed to show I was willing to work with existing systems before trying to build something new.

As time went by the flaws in the old process continued to emerge.  I then started networking and leveraging my credibility to gain cross-departmental buy in for a more effective process with governance via an official release manager role.  Item 3.3 is the proposal for that new process I submitted to senior management.  The proposal was accepted, and I was assigned the release manager position and put in charge of the process.

## Business Writing Sample

* [4.1-BusinessPlan-WritingSample.pdf](https://github.com/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/master/Communication-and-Writing-Samples/4.1-BusinessPlan-WritingSample.pdf)

The next item, [4.1-BusinessPlan-WritingSample.pdf](https://github.com/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/master/Communication-and-Writing-Samples/4.1-BusinessPlan-WritingSample.pdf), contains text I wrote for inclusion in a business plan we were utilizing to pitch to various venture capitalists.  I describe how I envisioned utilizing our product development structure for competitive advantage, as well as the logistics of creating the steering committee and release schedule. 

## Issue / Root Cause Analysis

* [5.1-Sprint-Issue-Analysis-Sample.pdf](https://github.com/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/master/Communication-and-Writing-Samples/5.1-Sprint-Issue-Analysis-Sample.pdf)

A team I managed which usually enjoyed a smooth sprint release process was really struggling to finalize their sprint deliverables and achieve code-complete status.  Theories as to why abounded, but no one had a clear picture in the heat of the moment as to the root cause(s).  What was clear; however, was that some sort of analysis was required once the stress of the release deadline had passed, and actions needed to be taken to ensure the root cause was properly identified and mitigated for future sprint cycles.  

Once my investigatory document was created and analysis performed it was obvious what had happened to the team, and I was able to ensure this type of situation didn't occur for my team again.
