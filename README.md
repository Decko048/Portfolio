# Summary

My name is Nathan Rasch, and I've been working as a software developer, manager, and project manager for the past fifteen plus years.

I have an MBA in business administration, a BA in Mathematics, I'm a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM), and a PMI Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM). I've worked in a number of challenging fields such as biopharmaceuticals, banking, and telecommunications.

Some of my recent, successful work experience includes:
* Building and managing software development and QC teams from the ground up including offshore resources and virtual environments
* Leadership, project management, and direction for new business initiatives and technical projects
* Working with business development and product management to analyze market spaces, competitors, financial plans, revenue projections, etc. in order to formulate short and medium term business goals as well as competitive strategy
* Rapid development of prototypes and features to explore new product ideas, features, and/or automated systems to reduce administrative overhead
* Interfacing and collaborating with clients and other high level managers in order to meet strategic organizational objectives
* Release management for a ten year $30M capital construction project for the state of Colorado

Examples of technologies I've worked with include:
* Programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and PHP 
* Database technologies such as SQL, Elasticsearch, and data warehousing
* Infrastructure technologies such as Linux, Amazon EC2/AWS, Nagios, Ansible, Pentaho
* Other technologies such as Git, Laravel, Selenium, Google docs, Trello, shell scripting, etc.

I've also recently started delving into machine learning to expand my skillset, and and you can find a sample of my work [here](https://github.com/nrasch/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine-Learning-and-AI).

In summary I believe my years of experience, technical expertise, and soft skills would be a valuable asset to any organization, and I look forward to speaking with you further about your company's business needs.
